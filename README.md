The Python File Organizer is a project designed to enhance file management by automating the organization of files within a specified directory.

Users provide a directory path as input, and the program then categorizes files based on their types, such as documents, images, videos, or other specified formats. 

The organizer creates separate folders for each file type and moves the corresponding files into their respective folders. 

This results in a more structured and orderly file system, making it easier for users to locate and manage their files.
